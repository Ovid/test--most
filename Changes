Revision history for Test::Most

0.21

0.21    2009-02-18
        - No changes.  Update version for release.

0.20_02 2008-11-26
        - Make sure tests don't fail if optional Data::Dumper::Names
          dependency is not met.

0.20_01 2008-11-25
        - Added &show.  Like &explain, but tries to show variable names.

0.20    2008-11-06
        - If a test dies because die_on_fail() or 'Test::Most qw(die)' is
          triggered, we now throw a 'Test::Most::Exception' rather than simply
          dieing.  This makes it easier for software to understand what's
          happening if this is trapped in an eval.
        - Have t/00-load.t report dependency versions since CPAN testers does
          not reliably do this.
        - Move some tests to xt/author to ensure that spurious failures don't
          cause CPAN install issues.

0.12    2008-10-15
        - Make sure we don't get redef warnings with Test::Builder 0.82.
        - Expose &set_failure_handler to people can customize it more.

0.11    2008-07-29
        - explain() now automatically uses Data::Dumper on references.

0.10    2008-07-22
        - Rename internal keys to begin with TEST_MOST_ instead of XXX_.
        - Rework tests to be slightly less comprehensive but more likely to
          pass (removed the otherwise lovely Test::Command until we can figure
          out what's up with it).

0.04   2008-06-19
        - Forget to add Test::Warn to Build.pl :)

0.03   2008-06-18
        - Remembered to add t/defer_plan.t to the manifest.  D'oh!

0.02    2008-06-18
        - Fixed Perl version in Build.PL to avoid problems with smoke testers
          skipping this test.
        - Added Test::Warn support (suggestion from benh).
        - Fixed bug whereby Test::Deep tests were not exported.  Whoops! :)
        - Add deferred plans.  Thanks to barefootcoder++ (Buddy Burden) for
          this.
        - Added build dependency on Test::Command (nice module!)

0.01    2008-01-13
